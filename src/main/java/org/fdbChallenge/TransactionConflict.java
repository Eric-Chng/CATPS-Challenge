            ANSWERING EXPLANATIONS
            I cannot be certain due to not being able to run the code but here is my expectation for the code
            1. If T1 and T2 have their operations interleaved (which is not a guarantee due to OS scheduling),
            I expect T2 to fail. This is because the range it is reading conflicts with the keys added by T1.
            This is a read-write conflict so the transaction aborts. If they are not interleaved, trivially the
            transaction will succeed.
            2. If T1 and T2 have their operations interleaved (which is not a guarantee due to OS scheduling),
            I expect T1 to fail. For similar reasons as above, the range it is reading and writing is touched by
            T2 as well.
            My reference for the above 2 questions is the FDB developer guide. Specifically this quote:
            "if a concurrent transaction happens to insert a new key anywhere in the range, our transaction
            will conflict with it and fail (resulting in a retry) because seeing the other transactionâ€™s write
            would change the result of the range read"
            ^ refers to read-write transactions
         */

        // Clear db
        BasicFDBOps.deleteKeyValue(db, "K1");
        BasicFDBOps.deleteKeyValue(db, "K2");

        // Close db
        db.close();
    }
}
